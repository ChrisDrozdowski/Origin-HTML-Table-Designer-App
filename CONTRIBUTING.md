## Reporting or Commenting on Issues

When reporting or commenting on an issue, please as detailed as possible and (as necessary) provide steps to reproduce an issue including sample code. Note: Do not include things such as private API keys in sample code. Rather, put a placeholder in their place and indicate that it is a placeholder.

Issues or comments that are along the lines of "It doesn't work" without further information will be summarily closed without comment.

## Pull Requests

When making pull requests to fix bugs or add features, please provide information about why you are making the request. If it is to fix bugs, please add a new issue prior to, or along with, the pull request.

Please adhere to a similar coding style as in the original files. They might not be to everyone's tastes, but consistency is important.

Note: No OCZ or otherwise encrypted files will be accepted for inclusion into this project.
